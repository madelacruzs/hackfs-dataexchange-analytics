Python ML Scripts for Automatic Pipeline



Hi and welcome to the **Data exchange and Analytics** project.

The main idea of our project is to generate a decentralized data marketplace with any type of dataset that can be used to train ML models using our automated service pipeline. The idea is to use IPFS with Fleek Space Daemon to upload and control the datasets per user using their buckets creating folders with the Ethereum address.

The data will be completely encrypted and the user would have full control, when a user upload their dataset an NFT will be created so it can be sell or transfered with another user.
